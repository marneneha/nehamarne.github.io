## Special Thanks
Thanks to Rohit Lal for the great template. I would not have been able to complete my website without his portfolio git repository. Do checkout his cool work at [https://rohitlal.net/](https://rohitlal.net/)

the website was build on Freelancer theme.

[Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) is a one page freelancer portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features several content sections, a responsive portfolio grid, window modals for each portfolio item, and a working PHP contact form.
